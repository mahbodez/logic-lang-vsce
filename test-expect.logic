# Test file for expect keyword functionality
# ==========================================

# Single variable declarations
expect mass_L
expect mass_R
expect mc_L

# Multiple variable declarations
expect birads_L, birads_R, comp
expect birads_score_L, birads_score_R

# Constants section
const high_threshold = 0.8
const low_threshold = 0.2
const important_classes = [4, 5, 6]

# Variable definitions using expected variables
define findings_L = mass_L | mc_L
define findings_R = mass_R | mc_R
define high_birads_L = sum(birads_L, important_classes)

# Threshold-based definitions
define high_risk_L = birads_score_L > high_threshold
define high_risk_R = birads_score_R > high_threshold

# Constraints
constraint exactly_one(birads_L) weight=1.0 transform="logbarrier"
constraint exactly_one(birads_R) weight=1.0 transform="logbarrier"
constraint exactly_one(comp) weight=0.7 transform="logbarrier"

# Implication constraints
constraint high_risk_L >> findings_L weight=0.8 transform="logbarrier"
constraint high_risk_R >> findings_R weight=0.8 transform="logbarrier"
